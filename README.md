# 🖥️ AWS Static Website Hosting on S3

This project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3.

## 📌 Overview

Amazon S3 allows you to serve static content (HTML, CSS, JS) without needing a server. In this project, I configured an S3 bucket to host a static website, made the contents publicly accessible, and tested access using the S3 website endpoint.
